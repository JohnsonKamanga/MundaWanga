# Application Idea
This was a school project for a software engineer course. It is a farm records management application that is to be used by farmers to keep track of their finances and records.

# Key features
- Dynamic record creation which allows farmers to create record schemas on the application that match their existing records.(allows farmers to maintaining their existing record schemas)
- Record keeping i.e crud operations on records.
- Finance management through the use of budgets.
- Local first approach to record keeping and finance management. All records are stored locally on user's devices using SQLite.
- Notifications eg alerting users when their budgets are being exceeded.
- Profit and loss determination based on farmer's cash flow.
  
### Features that I worked on
- Record keeping. My contribution on this was partial because I worked on part of the querying logic related to record keeping
- Finance management through the use of budgets. This includes all the basic crud operations and the user interface
- Notifications. My contribution on this was partial as well because I only implemented notifications related to finances

`PS, commits made by the user JohnsonKamanga123 are mine because that is my github account for school related projects`

# Welcome to your Expo app ðŸ‘‹

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
    npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.
